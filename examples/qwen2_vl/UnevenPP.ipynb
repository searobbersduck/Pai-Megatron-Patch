    "We denote the number of microbatches in a batch as $m$, the number of pipeline stages (number of devices used for pipeline parallelism) as $p$, the ideal time per iteration as $t_{id}$ (assuming perfect or ideal scaling), and the time to execute a single microbatchâ€™s forward and backward pass as $t_{f}$ and $t_{b}$. In this schedule, the pipeline bubble consists of $p - 1$ forward passes at the start of a batch, and $p - 1$ backward passes at the end. The total amount of time spent in the The pipeline bubble is then $t_{pb} = (p - 1)\\cdot(t_{f}+t_{b})$. The ideal processing time for the batch is $t_{id} = m\\cdot(t_{f} + t_{b})$. Therefore, the fraction of ideal computation time spent in the pipeline bubble is:\n",
